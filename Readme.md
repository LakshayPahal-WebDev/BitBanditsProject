# CopilotKit Mini LLM: Study Stress Companion

This CopilotKit project provides a mini machine learning model designed to assist users in managing study stress. The model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user input related to study anxieties and pressures.

## Key Features:

- Stress Recognition: The model can identify keywords and phrases indicative of study stress within user queries. Based on this analysis, it offers tailored support and resources.
- Coping Mechanisms: The model suggests practical coping strategies to help users manage stress, such as relaxation techniques, time management tips, and pointers for maintaining a healthy study-life balance.
- Encouragement and Support: The model's responses are crafted to be empathetic and encouraging, providing a sense of companionship and support during challenging study periods.
Getting Started:

Usage: The model can be incorporated into chatbots, virtual assistants, or other interactive applications designed to support student well-being. When a user expresses study stress, the model will be triggered to provide relevant guidance and support.
Customization: The model can be further customized by training it on additional stress-related keywords and phrases specific to your target user base or study domain.
